# PPProcessing
++Processing is a Processing-inspired domain specific language for creative coding. It compiles to C++ code powered by Openframeworks.

Very early in development: not working at all at the moment. C++ project files derived from tomassetti's tutorial. Warning: The program in its current stage does not free all memory it allocates.
